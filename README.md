# Editing a SwiftUI List

## Goal

SwiftUI's [List](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/list) is lovely in its ability to present our data in such an succinct manner. With a little bit of code, you can add code that will [delete rows](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-let-users-delete-rows-from-a-list) and [move rows](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/building-editable-swiftui-lists/).

I want to be able to add and rename rows as well.

## Current state

As of this writing, I'm able to add a row... even added a nice spring animation.
